# IP Tracker

This is a simple IP tracker where you input the IP and shows you the IP location in a map. I have used the public ipify API to get the IP address data. You can take a look at [https://www.ipify.org/](https://www.ipify.org/)

Also I used leafletJS for the map: [https://leafletjs.com/](https://leafletjs.com/). However I used the React version of it. You can find it here: [https://react-leaflet.js.org/](https://react-leaflet.js.org/)

A demo of this little project can be found here: [https://iptracker.karinaespinola.dev/](https://iptracker.karinaespinola.dev/)

If you would like to try it out remember to add you API key to the environment variable REACT_APP_APIFY_API_KEY. You can find a .env.example file in the repository.

Hope you like it! ☺️
